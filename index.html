    <p>The death penalty was first abolished from Australian culture in 1973 officially however, the last ever legal death penalty fulfilled was in 1967. The idea of having the death penalty was to limit the amount of crime that was around the area. The topic has arisen now in 2017-2018 asking the question, should the death penalty be reinstated in Australia. A person would only be sentenced to the penalty if they committed a serious crime which would be decided by the government.</p>

            <h3><strong>Evaluation</strong></h3>
            
    <p>
         The idea of having the death penalty back is that many people believe that it will lower the crime rates in an area as it will cause people to not do anything severe as to lose their own life. Another is that if someone is sentenced then it will teach all the other criminals a lesson about the consequences of committing a serious crime and that the rules are harsher, and the government isn’t afraid to do the worst. Many people also believe that having the penalty will cost less than keeping an inmate in prison, whereas that is wrong as it costs $31,000 per inmate per year, but the death penalty will cost taxpayers about $90,000 more each year. As an anonymous person has quote “we should show these evil people the same compassion they showed their victims” meaning that by having the penalty it will show the criminals how the victims felt as they were while being murdered and having the fear of death. Also, a question to ask is what if someone is mentally unstable and don’t fully understand what they are doing, so what are the risks that without the penalty they are likely to commit the same crime without meaning to.

        It is known that if the death penalty is reinstated in Australia that it won’t actually lower the crime rates. It has been proven that in the states in the U.S, as an example, is that the states that don’t have the death penalty have significantly lower crime rates than those who do have the death penalty. The penalty will also cost more in taxpayers money per year than the inmates in prison. It will roughly cost taxpayers $90,000 more per year to sentence someone to death than sentence someone to prison. Another important question that should be asked is what happens if someone is falsely accused or been set up then they get sentenced to the death penalty, then what happens because you can’t bring someone back from the dead. How would the family feel knowing their child/ relative did nothing wrong, yet they have to die for something they didn’t do. Also, what lesson is being taught if the government is fighting fire with fire. What lesson does that teach the younger generations. Another question to ask is should the government really be making the decisions to whether someone should be sentenced to the penalty or not. They do make a lot of mistakes and not always listen to what the people to say.
